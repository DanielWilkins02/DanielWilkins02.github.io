      <h1>A little view into my life...</h1>
	  <img id="picture" src="IMG/photo1.png" width="200" height="200">
	  <p>Greetings and salutations! My name is Daniel Wilkins, current student of URI and former of Queen of Heaven Academy. 
	  Looking into college the choice was always clear, computers have always fasinated me in a way nothing else has. 
	  The way you could define a set of parameters for a computer to preform, allowing you to overcome tasks beyond any one persons capibility.</p>
	  
	  <p>I saw computers as an extension of humanity's skillset, and a great increase in it's potential. 
	  As such, computer engineering is my path, one that I am excited to undertake.</p>
	  
	  <p>In the past I have worked on self-taught coding courses, through which I have created several games you can find over at my <a href="apps.html">apps</a> page!
	  In addition to the hobby of self taught coding, I enjoy the product of other's programming knowledge in a large varity of PC games. 
	  Also, from time to time you can find me down at the library enjoying books, everything from historical to sci-fi.</p>
